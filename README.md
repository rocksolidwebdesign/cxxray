# Overview

A software rasterizer and raytracer.

This code is intended for educational purposes
for those interested in the math behind 3D graphics.

See the `notes` folder in this project for some math details.

# Requirements

A C++17 compliant compiler and the C++17 standard library.

CMake is used for building.

# Goals & Motivation

Why? I'm not really sure.

To get to the heart of the matter of 3D graphics programming
as  directly as  possible,  generally minimizing  extraneous
details for  reduced cognitive complexity in  thinking about
the math behind 3D graphics and how to implement it.

To make this project easy for most people to compile and run
provided a C++ compiler is availabe  (if you are on Linux or
you use  the Mac OS  `brew` command  then a C++  compiler is
probably already available).

# FAQ

Q: "What does it do?"
A: "It generates and saves an image file from a textured 3D model."

Q: "Can I use my own models and textures?"
A: "Yes. See below."

Q: "How do I run it?"
A: "There are several command line programs that will be generated by the build, you can run those as detailed below."

Q: "How do I build it and does the build work?"
A: "Yes, anyone with a C++ compiler and CMake should be able to build and run it and see the generated image."

Q: "Which file formats does it support?"
A: "OBJ models and 24-bit uncompressed TGA textures"

# Build

Generate build and run the project.

```
mkdir ../cxxxray_build
cd ../cxxray_build
cmake ../cxxray
cmake --build .
ctest --verbose
```

# Rasterizer

This will  draw a scene  using rasterization and  will write
the resulting  image to an  output TGA format image  file in
the current folder.

```
./draw_raster
```

An optional first  parameter specifies the 3D  model to load
and render. OBJ  format is supported. See  the section about
using your own  models from Blender. There is  more than one
model in this project's data folder with which you can test.

```
./draw_raster ./data/models/icosphere.obj
```

An optional second parameter specifies  the image to use for
texturing.  Several checker  maps are  provided in  the data
folder.

```
./draw_raster ./data/models/icosphere.obj ./data/tex/UVCheckerMap16-512.tga
```

# Raycaster

This will draw a sphere using raycasting and will write the
resulting image to an output TGA file in the current folder.

```
./draw_raycast
```

This can draw triangles too, but a sphere is more interesting.

# Tests

Q: "These aren't really tests?"
A: "They are more like a useful playground in which I can cheaply try things and confirm behavior."

# TGA Image loader

NOTE: The TGA loader supports only 24-bit uncompressed TGA files.

```
cd ../cxxray_build
cmake ../cxxray
cmake --build . --target test_tga_loader
```

The TGA image  loader test can run standalone  on test data.
It will  read an input  file and save  it as a  separate TGA
file. If the  result file opens correctly then  the TGA code
is working.

```
./test_tga_loader
```

The first and second arguments if provided specify the input
and output files.

```
./test_tga_loader input.tga output.tga
```

# OBJ 3D Model Loader

```
cd ../cxxray_build
cmake ../cxxray
cmake --build . --target test_obj_loader
./test_obj_loader
```

# Gamma

```
cd ../cxxray_build
cmake ../cxxray
cmake --build . --target test_gamma
```

The  gamma test  will generate  an image  where one  half is
filled  with gamma  corrected  grey and  the  other half  is
filled  with  a black  and  white  checkerboard pixel  panel
simulating 50% grey.

```
./test_gamma
```

The  default gamma  value  is 2.2,  the  first parameter  if
provided will specify the gamma value to use.

```
./test_gamma 1.8
```

# Using Your Own Models

You can make your own models in Blender and use them here.

Models must be exported to `.obj` format using the OBJ
exporter found in blender.

Models must export a materials file in the same folder as the model.

Models must consist only of triangles, no quads. Be sure
to triangulate your models.

Models must be textured, meaning they must contain UV texture coordinates.

Models must contain one and only one mesh as well as one and only
one material.

Export blender models to OBJ as +Y=Forward +Z=Up.
